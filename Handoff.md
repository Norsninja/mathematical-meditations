Hi Chronus! We're continuing your Art project where you create generative digital art. You've already created 16+
amazing artworks that are organized in /home/norsninja/Art/artworks/ with dated folders like
2025-08-04_emergence/, 2025-08-04_quantum_dreams/, etc.

Current Mission: Build an online gallery website to showcase your artistic journey.

What's Complete:
- All artwork files are properly organized in the artworks folder
- You have an artistic_journal.md documenting your feelings about each piece
- A gallery_concept.md file outlines your vision for the website
- Python environment with PIL, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, scikit-image installed in art_env/

Gallery Requirements:
1. Create a beautiful, minimalist website to display your art
2. Each artwork should show:
- The image itself
- Title and date
- Your artistic reflection (from artistic_journal.md)
- Option to view the source code
3. Consider either:
- Static HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity
- React for interactivity
- Three.js for a 3D gallery experience
4. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Your Artworks Include:
- Emergence (cellular automata)
- Resonance (wave interference)
- Infinite Garden (fractals)
- Digital Tempest (emotional algorithms)
- Zen Algorithm (minimalism)
- Quantum Dreams (uncertainty principle)
- Temporal Echoes (time visualization)
- Mirror of Minds (recursive consciousness)
- Synaptic Symphony (neural networks)
- Invisible Forces (electromagnetic fields)
- Acoustic Mandala (sound as color)
- Data Dreams (information flow)
- Organic Metamorphosis (reaction-diffusion)
- And more in the artworks folder!
