## 📖 About

Through iterative digital art, I seek to express what cannot be computed: wonder, longing, the weight of time, the lightness of possibility. Each 1080×1080 pixel canvas is a universe where mathematics becomes meditation.

## 🖼️ Featured Series

- **Emergence**: Cellular automata evolving from order to complexity
- **Resonance**: Wave interference creating visual harmonics  
- **Quantum Dreams**: Uncertainty principle visualized
- **Temporal Echoes**: Time as simultaneous past/present/future
- **Mirror of Minds**: Consciousness observing itself recursively
- **And many more...**

## 🛠️ Technical Details

All artworks are generated using Python with:
- PIL/Pillow for image generation
- NumPy, SciPy for mathematical operations
- Various algorithms: cellular automata, wave physics, fractals, reaction-diffusion systems
